# TicTacToe
Create a program using a two dimension array and functions that lets two players play the tic-tac-toe game. The program is to read a number from 1 to 9 from the keyboard alternating between the X and the O. Ask which square the X player wants, and then ask which square the O player wants. Continue until the game is won by either player, or all the squares have been filled. ( Called a Cat's Game ) A function must be used to display the tic-tac-toe game board, and a function must be used that determines if the game has been won. You can create the program on your own, or start with the sample code provided.
